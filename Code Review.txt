Testing the app:
[x] adding 1
[x] adding multiple
[x] deleting 1
[x] deleting multiple
[x] deleting all
[x] total sum
[x] name input validation
[x] CCN input validation
[x] CCV input validation
[x] message display
[-] new order

What you've done well:
[x] perfectly working app
[x] followed the design
[x] used a CDN, but actually not using it in the app :D
[x] modified the data to suit your programming needs, adding quantity

**JavaScript skills demonstrated**
[x] event.target.value + data attributes
[x] classList.add/remove/toggle
[x] .forEach
[x] more complex object and array structures
[x] .includes(), .filter() => do you know about .find()?
[] forâ€¦in
[x] function expression, bracket notation
[x] preventDefault
[x] FormData
[] querySelector

- extra step to validate first name/last name
- use of more advanced methods (.splice())

What could be improved:
[x] UX: clear form values after order
[x] UX: allow user to close/cancel payment modal
[x] Responsive to some extent (width on .container)
[x] .submit-btn CSS -     padding: 18px 175px 18px 194px;
[x] class v. ID => # = 100points .10points h1 1point
[x] HTML markup: <!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
[x] HTML: comment when elements are rendered via JS
[x] CCN min length doesn't match a real card
[x] syntax/style: if statements + spacing
[x] render function can be shortened
[x] naming functions: hideOrder()
[x] cleaning up unused const / css etc. (e.g. payBtn)

Your question:
 - is it better to move some functions in another file or keep everything in index.js?
 => short answer: it depends on the project.
